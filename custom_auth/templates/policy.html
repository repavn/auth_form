<p>Effective date: May 19, 2020
Thanks for entrusting GitHub Inc. (“GitHub”, “we”) with your source code, your projects, and your personal information.
Holding on to your private information is a serious responsibility, and we want you to know how we're handling it.
The controller responsible for the processing of your personal information in connection with the Service is GitHub,
Inc., 88 Colin P. Kelly Jr. Street, San Francisco, CA 94107, privacy@github.com.</p>

<p>
The goal of GitHub's open source licensing efforts is to provide a starting point to help you make an informed choice.
GitHub displays license information to help users get information about open source licenses and the projects that use them.
We hope it helps, but please keep in mind that we’re not lawyers and that we make mistakes like everyone else.
For that reason, GitHub provides the information on an “as-is” basis and makes no warranties regarding any information
or licenses provided on or through it, and disclaims liability for damages resulting from using the license information.
If you have any questions regarding the right license for your code or any other legal issues relating to it,
it’s always best to consult with a professional.
</p>

<p>
GitHub is a lot of things, but it’s not a law firm. As such, GitHub does not provide legal advice. Using the Licenses
API or sending us an email about it does not constitute legal advice nor does it create an attorney-client relationship.
If you have any questions about what you can and can't do with a particular license,
you should consult with your own legal counsel before moving forward.
In fact, you should always consult with your own lawyer before making any decisions that might
have legal ramifications or that may impact your legal rights.

GitHub created the License API to help users get information about open source licenses and the projects that use them.
We hope it helps, but please keep in mind that we’re not lawyers (at least not most of us aren't)
and that we make mistakes like everyone else. For that reason, GitHub provides the API on an “as-is”
basis and makes no warranties regarding any information or licenses provided on or through it, and disclaims
liability for damages resulting from using the API.
